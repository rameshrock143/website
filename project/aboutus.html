			<h2 id="about">PATAN</h2>
			<p>
				The history of the Durbar Square is not clear. Although the Malla Kings of Lalitpur are credited with the establishment of the royal square, it is known that the site is an ancient crossroad. The Pradhanas, who settled around the site before the Mallas, have connections with the Durbar Square.[1] Some chronicles hint that the Thakuri Dynasty built a palace and made reforms to the locality, but there is little evidence of this. Scholars are certain that Patan was a prosperous city since ancient times.[6]

The Malla Kings made important changes to the square. Most of the current architecture is from the 1600s, constructed during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla and his son Srinivasa Sukriti. Some of the notable Malla Kings who improved the square include Purandarasimha, Sivasimha Malla and Yoganarendra Malla.

The dham has been drawing tourists and pilgrims from the world over , so it ' s definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in , or even near , Nawalparasi district. And even if you aren ' t a particularly religious person, there' s a lot to check out at the dham .</P>
